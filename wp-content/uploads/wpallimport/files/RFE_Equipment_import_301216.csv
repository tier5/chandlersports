There are 5 standard positions in spinning: seated flat, standing flat, seated climb, standing climb and jumps.  The emphasis of spinning is to replicate road bikes movements as closely as possible at the same time working key muscles in the legs, core, back and upper body for a more complete workout. To aid this, the S1 features a substantial 14kg flywheel, providing the rider with a much smoother ride compared to standard exercise bikes.  32 levels of electronically controlled resistance also provide that extra challenge.  The new and innovative self-powered generator system means that you can take your workout anywhere without the need to worry about a power source.  Your motion powers such features as the hand pulse sensor and the versatile computer display which shows a wide range of functions including speed, time, distance and your calories burnt to stay on top of your workout.","Spin bikes can help maximise your body’s fat burning ability and at the same time offering a low impact workout.
