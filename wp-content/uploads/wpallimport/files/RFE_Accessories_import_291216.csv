Push-ups are a great exercise to build upper body and core strength. Simple yet effective, they can be incorporated into any workout, anywhere.</p><p>The adidas Swivel Push Up Bars enhance and add variety in performing this staple body weight exercise, transforming the ordinary push-up into an extraordinary push-up.</p><p>By adding a unique swivel action, the swivel push-up bars enable you to lock out your wrist and rotate as you lower to the push-up position. This calls upon more chest, shoulder and back muscle than a regular push up meaning bigger, better results in less time. As it's a natural movement, it actively reduces strain on the elbow and wrist joints and the smooth bearing discs help make it one smooth rotation. Alternatively the bars can be locked in position for traditional static push-ups.</p><p>Sold as a pair.</p>",,"Lightweight non-slip design, Rotating push-up handles which can also be locked into position, Smooth ball-bearing disc, Supportive and comfortable",22,22,11.6,,,,,,,No,1 year,4-adac-11401.jpg,ad-11401-swivel-push-up-bars-other.jpg,adac-11401-adidas-swivel-push-up-bars-lifestyle-1.jpg,, ,Training,Push-up Stands

With the TrainBar you 'load' the muscles that rotate the torso which basically means you will develop '3 dimensional' strength rather than only working through a single plane of motion. </p><p>If you position your hands close together on the bar you'll notice the challenge to the shoulder muscles increases when you do any exercises that involve rotation. </p><p>The TrainBar enables you to work all three planes of motion against a challenging level of resistance so you can develop a strong core and perform functional strength exercises in no time. </p><p>This adidas product is suitable for outdoor fitness so you can attach it to street furniture or any solid item at the park or in your garden.

Suspension rings are a fantastic way to increase difficulty for advanced lifters and offer a great deal of mobility as well as being an excellent method for performing versatile upper and lower body workouts.</p><p>With the increased movement of any exercise, the rings and straps will move and vibrate forcing the user to apply a greater degree of muscle activation. You'll train your core to the maximum due to the rings' instability and free movement. </p><p>Use these pair of Reebok Suspension Rings to perform exercises such as dips, push ups, lunges and muscle ups through the use of the heavy-duty nylon adjustable straps which can be easily released using the quick-release buckle. </p><p>Suitable for gym use and all functional areas, common exercises can take on a whole new dimension when performed using the rings.

You can move the lightweight Yoga block to the positions that best suit you and your practice level. The block basically brings the floor closer to you and its non-standard, 'cut-out' shape provides additional grip and stability, more so than your typical Yoga block. </p><p>When performing your downward dog, you may find you can't quite reach the floor without the pose becoming uncomfortable. The shaped Yoga block, measuring at 22.8 x 15.2 x 7.6cm can then be used to help train you in becoming more flexible, and able to reach the floor without using it.</p> <p>Though there's more to the firm Reebok Yoga Block than stretching and balance assistance, it can also be used for general strength exercises, adding another level of intensity to your Yoga workout. The block is particularly useful in learning internal and external rotation moves. Plus, if you're performing restorative Yoga, practice designed to relax and restore your body, the green Reebok Yoga block is good for that too.</p>",,"22.8 x 15.2 x 7.6cm, Lightweight, firm Yoga block that aids in a variety of poses, Shaped design provides additional grip and stability, Shaped Yoga Block",22.8,15.2,7.6,,,,,,,No,,rayg-10035gn-shaped-yoga-block-product-1.jpg,rayg-10035gn-shaped-yoga-block-product-2.jpg,rayg-10035gn-shaped-yoga-block-product-3.jpg,rayg-10035gn-shaped-yoga-block-lifestyle-1.jpg, ,Yoga,Yoga
